# Neural-Network-with-Keras
This project is about to understand how to use the package Keras in different data science tasks. I joined different funtionalities from different packages to created artifitial neural networks. Most of the techniques I used in this project I listed them below.

- Cross Validation and Bootstrap
- Drop Out and Batch Normalization
- Convolutional Neural Network
- Pre-Trained Convolutional Neural Network
